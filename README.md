# Zodiac-Sign-C++
Thatâ€™s a project for zodiac sign calculator but written in with C++. 

I actually have a previous repo about the same zodiac calculator but, again want to do a Xcode project with C/C++, and show how to write C/C++ in a Mac, especially I used functions and string operation for this one. Because this was a problem for me, writing C/C++ in a Mac. I hope this could be helpful for someone else that has a problem like me. 

And, of course you can add rising sign and things like that for the zodiac sign calculator.

Here is the output of the project:
