# Zodiac-Sign-C++
That’s a project for zodiac sign calculator but written in with C++. 

I actually have a previous repo about the same zodiac calculator but, again I wanted to do a Xcode project with C/C++, and show how to write C++ in a Mac, especially I used functions and string operation for this one. Because this was a problem for me, writing C/C++ in a Mac. I hope this could be helpful for someone else that has a problem like me. 

And, of course you can add rising sign and things like that for the zodiac sign calculator.


// There is a problem that i cannot solve. Even if name identified as a string, you can enter an integer in the output section for name variable.

// I couldn't fixed this problem...



Here is the output of the project:
